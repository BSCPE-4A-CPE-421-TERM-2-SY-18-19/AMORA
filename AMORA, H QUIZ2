How did the Rasp Pi work?

- The charger that was used wasn't compatible with the version of rasp pi that we are using.
The previous charger was for a B+ model while the appropriate charger is for a B model.
The model B uses between 1000 mA depending on what peripherals are connected. To test its functionality, we connected it to the right & compatible charger.
